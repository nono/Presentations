# Polling & Long-polling

* It's OK if you have less than one message per second
* Can consume many resources if you have many clients
* But it works!

!SLIDE
# HTTP Streaming #

* Very complicated to use in browsers
* But OK for other use cases

!SLIDE
# WebSockets #

* Probably too complex
* Not easy to deploy

!SLIDE
# EventSource #

* Send pings if you want to keep the connection active
* Polyfill for old browsers
* Easy to implement and deploy
